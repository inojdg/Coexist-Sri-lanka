        <h2 id="about-title">About the Conflict</h2>
        <p>     The Human–Elephant Conflict (HEC) in Sri Lanka is one of the most critical 
      environmental and social issues facing the country today. As farmlands expand 
      and forests shrink, elephants lose access to their natural feeding grounds, 
      pushing them closer to human settlements in search of food and water. 
      What was once peaceful coexistence has turned into frequent confrontation — 
      causing tragic losses for both elephants and people.
            
    </p>

        <div class="about-cards">
          <article class="about-card">
            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>The main drivers of HEC are <strong>deforestation</strong>, 
          <strong>encroachment into elephant corridors</strong>, and 
          <strong>unplanned agricultural expansion</strong>. 
          Elephants are highly mobile animals that rely on migratory routes — 
          when these paths are blocked by farms, fences, or roads, 
          they wander into villages. Additionally, the cultivation of crops like 
          paddy and bananas near forest edges attracts elephants due to the 
          easy availability of food.
</p>
          </article>
          <article class="about-card">
            <h3>Impacts</h3>
            <p>The effects of HEC are devastating for both species. 
          <strong>Farmers lose their livelihoods</strong> as crops and homes are destroyed, 
          while elephants are often killed in retaliation through traps, electrocution, 
          or gunfire. The emotional and economic toll on rural families is enormous. 
          On the ecological side, the loss of elephants disrupts the balance of 
          ecosystems — elephants are keystone species vital for seed dispersal 
          and forest regeneration.
</p>
          </article>
          <article class="about-card">
            <h3>Statistics</h3>
            <p>Sri Lanka records over <strong>400 elephant deaths</strong> 
          and around <strong>100 human deaths</strong> annually due to conflict. 
          The island, once home to vast elephant ranges, has now lost over 
          <strong>76% of its natural elephant habitat</strong>. 
          Despite numerous conservation efforts, the number of incidents continues to rise, 
          making Sri Lanka one of the countries with the highest elephant mortality rates 
          relative to its population size.

        <div class="about-extended">
          <h3>Root Causes & Long-Term View</h3>
          <p>Solving this crisis requires a balance between conservation and community well-being. 
        Projects across Sri Lanka are now promoting <strong>community-based conservation</strong> 
        — empowering villagers to protect crops using eco-friendly deterrents, 
        and educating them on safe coexistence.  
        Sustainable land-use planning, wildlife corridors, and early-warning systems 
        are being implemented to reduce deadly encounters.</p>

        <p>
        With coordinated policy, scientific research, and public participation, 
        Sri Lanka can transition from conflict to coexistence — where elephants 
        once again roam freely without posing a threat to people, and where 
        communities can thrive without fear.

        <h2 id="solutions-title">Solutions and Strategies</h2>
        <p> Preventing the Human–Elephant Conflict (HEC) requires coordinated, 
      science-based, and community-centered approaches. 
      By combining traditional knowledge with modern technology, 
      Sri Lanka is paving the way toward sustainable coexistence between 
      humans and elephants.
</p>

        <div class="solutions-cards">
          <article class="solution-card"><h3>Fencing & Barriers</h3><p>Properly designed <strong>electric fences</strong> and 
          <strong>natural barriers</strong> are among the most effective ways 
          to protect farms and homes. Community-managed fences tend to 
          last longer than government-installed ones because villagers 
          take ownership of maintenance. In some areas, thick hedges of 
          citronella and chili plants are used as natural deterrents, 
          offering a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative.</p></article>
          <article class="solution-card"><h3>Safe Farming Practices</h3><p>Farmers are encouraged to cultivate crops that elephants naturally 
          avoid, such as citrus, chili, or ginger. Early harvesting, 
          solar-powered light systems, and community crop-watching groups 
          further reduce nighttime encounters. These methods not only protect 
          farmers’ livelihoods but also minimize harm to elephants who wander 
          into human zones.</p></article>
          <article class="solution-card"><h3>Early Warning Systems</h3><p>Technology plays a vital role in coexistence. 
          <strong>GPS collars</strong> fitted on elephant herds, 
          <strong>motion sensors</strong>, and <strong>SMS alert systems</strong> 
          now allow early detection of elephant movement. 
          Local communities receive real-time alerts, enabling 
          preventive actions before elephants enter villages.</p></article>
          <article class="solution-card"><h3>Community Education</h3><p>Awareness programs, school campaigns, and local workshops teach 
          safe behavior around elephants and promote understanding of 
          elephant behavior. By changing fear into knowledge, these programs 
          foster compassion and responsibility toward wildlife.</p></article>
          <article class="solution-card"><h3>Wildlife Corridors</h3><p>Establishing dedicated <strong>migration corridors</strong> allows elephants 
          to move safely between forest areas without entering farmlands. 
          Several corridors in North Central and Eastern Provinces have already 
          reduced fatal encounters. Mapping and restoring these routes is crucial 
          for long-term coexistence.
</p></article>
          <article class="solution-card"><h3>Government & NGO Collaboration</h3><p>The Department of Wildlife Conservation...The Department of Wildlife Conservation, together with NGOs like 
          RARE Sri Lanka and the Wildlife Conservation Society, actively supports 
          research, rescue operations, and policy reforms. 
          Public donations and volunteer programs strengthen these efforts, 
          helping rural communities coexist safely with elephants.
